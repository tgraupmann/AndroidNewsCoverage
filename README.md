# AndroidNewsCoverage

This is an Android Studio project for an Android app that displays news sites in a WebView.

The header has two buttons.

* More Left - Switches to a news site that is more liberal

* More Right - Switches to a news site that is more conservative

This app is inspired by the article [What I Discovered About Trump and Clinton From Analyzing 4 Million Facebook Posts](https://shift.newco.co/what-i-discovered-about-trump-and-clinton-from-analyzing-4-million-facebook-posts-922a4381fd2f#.eiq8vpcrc).
